 Some feedback to uploader:

 1. Please read
    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/ctan/CTAN-upload-addendum.html#crlf
    All your text files had Windows type line endings and the
    zip program did not provide the necessary "flags" for
    correcting this automatically.  So I corrected the line
    endings manually using the "fromdos" utility.

 2. The licence clauses in your .bst files sound somewhat
    mysterious to me:  "either this version of this license or
    (at your option) any later version.", where one does not
    know what "_this_ version" is.
    (The README specifies version 1.3c alright.)
    Could you please harmonize these statements for your next
    release (no need to re-upload now just because of this
    detail).

 3. Please read
    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/ctan/CTAN-upload-addendum.html#urls
    I found the following URLs in csf/cp1256fa.csf:
             ftp.tex.ac.uk:/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/8-bit
             ftp.shsu.edu:/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/8-bit
             ftp.uni-stuttgart.de:/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/8-bit
    Please replace "ftp.tex.ac.uk:/tex-archive/",
                   "ftp.shsu.edu:/tex-archive/"
             and   "ftp.uni-stuttgart.de:/tex-archive/"
             with  "http://mirror.ctan.org/"
    for your next release.  Thanks in advance!
              

 The update has been installed on the German server and _should_
 make its way to the mirrors within the next 24 hours.
 (As a matter of fact, we are experiencing at the moment a
 severe problem with our mirroring mechanism, but at least
 migration to TeX Live seems assured.)
